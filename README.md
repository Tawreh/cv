## About me
I’m Sophie, a 26-year-old, 6’2″ web developer based in Bristol. I moved here from Lincolnshire when I started university and fell head-over-heels for the place. :)

A graduate of Web Design from UWE in Bristol, I like wearing silly hats, drinking coffee, listening to music, baking, drawing, typography and fantasy writing. And cats. I really like cats.

> *   Using existing modules to create complex functionality on sites, particularly using views, content access and internationalisation/translation

## Study
#### BSc(hons) in Web Design
> Studied at <abbr title="University of the West of England">UWE</abbr> Bristol from September 2009 to July 2013, graduating with a first class degree.

> My final year project was [Fontastica](http://fontastica.herbal-jazz.net), a font finder. Using Google's API, the site provided random combinations of fonts in header-body format and allowed users to rate them ("I like this!" or "This sucks!"). Its purpose was to give designers ideas for type combinations on websites, assuming that it's either difficult to come up with a good combination, or they stick to the same old thing.

> It was built using CodeIgniter, which I hadn't used before, and was coded between October 2012 and April 2013\. The [accompanying report](/cv/dmp/report.pdf) (a large PDF ... you've been warned) was written throughout the year alongside the project work.

> Other modules included:
> *   Final year: a digital media project ([Fontastica, a font finder](http://fontastica.herbal-jazz.net)), interaction design ([logbook of work](http://id.herbal-jazz.net/)), consultancy project (working with Bristol Women’s Voice), advanced topics in web development (creating a RESTful API system)
> *   Third year: placement at [Circle Interactive](http://circle-interactive.co.uk/)
> *   Second year: human-computer interaction, information architecture, web design principles
> *   First year: information design, media technologies (basic knowledge of Flash and ActionScript 3.0 programming)

#### A-levels
> Attended <abbr title="Sleaford Joint Sixth Form">SJSF</abbr> in Lincolnshire from September 2007 to July 2009\. Left with three A-levels and one BTEC Certificate in Art & Design (grade MM).

> BTEC units included: photography, fashion illustration, textile work, art history, logo/brand design, web design (in final major project, self-created brief), typography.

> A-levels achieved in English Language (B), Chemistry (C) and General Studies.

<section class="what">
## What I can bring to the table
I’ve been working with the web since I was 14, and since then I’ve become a huge believer in making things simple and easy to use, both for the end user and for any developer who will take up work after me. I’m keen to broaden my horizons and learn new things, rather than stagnating in a single place.

During my placement and subsequent employment I feel I’ve become a stronger team player, and I work well with like-minded and enthusiastic people. However, I thrive best when given a task to do and a deadline, and am capable of putting my head down and concentrating on a single project.

I enjoy learning and sharing new knowledge with others. I keep up with news on Twitter, listen to web-related podcasts, and, when possible, I attend conferences. As a placement student I learned from my colleagues, and try to pass on that help to students in turn, whenever possible.

Oh ... and I really like writing documentation! I know that sounds weird, but I think it’s important to make it as easy as possible for others to pick up systems. I get frustrated when documentation isn’t provided, so I do my best to provide it for others.
